1. 🚨 BUG FIX: "Accept Candidate" Button Throws Error
Current Issue:
When pressing the "Accept Candidate" button within the applicant modal, the system returns an error and fails to update the candidate’s status in Airtable.

Required Behavior:

✅ When the button is clicked:

The system must update the candidate’s status to "Accepted" in Airtable (in the correct base and table).

This update must include any related fields (e.g., status, shortlist, accepted, interview_stage, etc.).

The update must be fully confirmed before triggering any follow-up logic.

🔄 No follow-up logic (e.g., opening face-to-face interview scheduler or status advancement) should run until Airtable confirms that the status update is successful.

📬 A visual confirmation message should appear saying:

✅ Candidate successfully accepted and status updated.

❌ If there’s any failure (network issue, Airtable delay, wrong base/table/field names), a clear error message should be shown (e.g., "Error: Failed to update candidate status in Airtable. Please try again.") — no silent failures allowed.

2. ⭐ NEW FEATURE: "Shortlist" Button & Modal Inside Applicants Modal
Goal:
Allow employers to shortlist candidates directly from the applicants modal and view the shortlist separately.

What to Build:

Add a “Shortlist” button next to each applicant’s card inside the applicant modal.

When clicked:

That candidate is marked in Airtable with a field like shortlisted: true.

Show a toast saying:

📥 Candidate added to shortlist.

Add a "View Shortlist" button (or tab) in the modal:

Clicking it shows only candidates marked as shortlisted: true.

Each candidate entry must have a "View Full Profile" button (see next section).

3. 📄 ENSURE FULL PROFILE IS FETCHED & DISPLAYED ACCURATELY
Problem:
Currently, pressing “View Profile” does not fetch the complete, accurate, and processed profile.

Required Behavior:

When "View Profile" is clicked (whether in applicant view or shortlist):

🔁 Fetch and display the following:

Manually filled profile info (personal info, skills, education, etc.).

AI Interview Analysis:

Technical skills evaluation.

Experience evaluation.

Cultural fit evaluation.

An overall blunt summary — NOT sugarcoated.

Statements like:

“The candidate demonstrated strong technical ability BUT struggled to explain real-world applications.”

“Claims knowledge of XYZ tools but gave surface-level answers with no examples.”

“Mentioned certifications but failed to provide proof; requires verification.”

🧠 If the answers are weak, this should be clearly written in the summary (e.g., “Candidate lacked clarity in multiple answers and failed to show depth in critical thinking.”).

💡 Each section should include suggested face-to-face interview follow-up questions based on weak points or gaps.

💾 All this data must be saved and synced with Airtable under appropriate fields (full_profile_data, ai_summary, recommendations, etc.).
