Feature: Applicant Qualifier (replace “Resume Searcher”)
Objective

Evaluate each candidate’s resume against a specific job posting, produce a 0–100 qualification score with reasons, and automatically advance qualified candidates to interviews.

Rename

Change the button label everywhere from “Resume Searcher” to “Applicant Qualifier.”

Inputs

Candidate object including stored resume text.

Job object including title, full description, required skills (comma-separated), and optional nice-to-have skills.

Configurable pass threshold (default 70).

UI toggle: Auto-advance if score ≥ threshold (default ON).

Processing Requirements

Normalize resume and job text for matching.

Determine matched skills and missing skills using required and nice-to-have lists, plus relevant keywords from the job description.

Compute a 0–100 qualification score:

Required skills contribute the majority of the score.

Nice-to-have skills and job description keywords contribute the remainder.

If more than half of required skills are missing and few nice-to-haves are present, cap the score to prevent false passes.

Store each qualification result with candidate ID, job ID, score, matched list, missing list, timestamp, and whether the candidate advanced.

Decision Rule

If Auto-advance = ON and score ≥ threshold, set candidate stage to Interview 1.

Otherwise, keep the current stage unchanged.

UI Requirements

Button text: Applicant Qualifier (replaces “Resume Searcher”).

On click, show a results modal containing:

Score (0–100)

Matched skills (list)

Missing skills (list)

Decision: Advanced / Not Advanced

Pass threshold value

Auto-advance toggle (ON by default)

On the candidate card, display the most recent score as the badge/number.

Data & Logging

Persist each qualification result (candidate, job, score, matched, missing, decision, timestamp).

Update the candidate’s stage only when the decision is “Advanced.”

Do not overwrite prior results; keep history.

Constraints

Assume resume text is already extracted and stored.

Single candidate qualified against a single job at a time.

No external AI services required; qualification is deterministic.

No scheduling, batch runs, or multi-job comparisons.

Success Criteria

The button is renamed to Applicant Qualifier everywhere.

Running the qualifier shows score, reasons, and decision in the modal.

Toggling Auto-advance controls whether passing candidates move to Interview 1.

Qualification results are persisted and visible; the latest score appears on the candidate card.

Changing the pass threshold updates pass/fail behavior for subsequent qualifications.
