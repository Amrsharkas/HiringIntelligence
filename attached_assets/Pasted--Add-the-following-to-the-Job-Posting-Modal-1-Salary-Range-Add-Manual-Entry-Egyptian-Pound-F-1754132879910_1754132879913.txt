‚úÖ Add the following to the Job Posting Modal:
1. Salary Range ‚Äî Add Manual Entry + Egyptian Pound Formatting
Keep current salary functionality as-is.

Add new option for employers to:

Enter "From" and "To" salary range manually (two input boxes).

Format: EGP only (no currency selector).

Add predefined dropdown ranges as quick selections (e.g., 8K‚Äì12K EGP, 12K‚Äì18K EGP) ‚Äî selecting one should auto-fill the fields but still allow editing.

Add an optional checkbox like ‚ÄúNegotiable‚Äù that overrides the range.

Validation: Prevent extremely wide gaps unless intentionally marked as open-ended.

2. Soft Skills ‚Äî Add Dropdown + Manual Input
Keep current soft skills entry.

Add dropdown with common soft skills (e.g., Communication, Time Management, Teamwork).

Allow employers to also manually enter custom skills.

Both dropdown selections and manual entries should appear as tags below the input.

3. Technical Skills ‚Äî Add Dropdown + Manual Input
Keep current technical skills logic.

Add a suggested dropdown list based on job title/role (use AI context detection if possible).

Allow manual writing of technical skills not listed in the dropdown.

Display all skills (from dropdown or manual input) as tags.

üß± Add These New Metadata Fields (Just as Add-ons):

üîÑ UX & Integration Guidelines:
The current workflow and logic must remain intact ‚Äî no fields or flows are to be removed or renamed.

These enhancements are additions only and should not interfere with the existing job posting behavior.

New fields should enhance the AI‚Äôs ability to match and filter candidates more accurately ‚Äî especially if candidate filtering is based on job metadata.

Use clear validation where applicable (e.g., salary range should not be negative or reversed).
