Enable the AI to automatically generate high-quality, role-specific job descriptions and job requirements based on a full analysis of the employer's job posting inputs ‚Äî with a logical restructuring of the modal to optimize flow.

‚úÖ What the AI Must Do:
1. Analyze All Input Fields:

The AI should analyze and synthesize the following fields from the job posting modal:

Job Title

Employment Type (Full-time, Part-time, etc.)

Workplace Type (Remote, On-site, Hybrid)

Seniority Level (Entry-level to Lead)

Industry

Languages Required

Certifications (if any)

These inputs are to be intelligently interpreted and used to generate the following two fields:

‚û§ A. Job Description (Auto-Generated)
The AI should use the job title, industry, seniority level, and employment/workplace types to write a clear, appealing, and accurate job description.

The description should be tailored to the local market (Egypt) when applicable.

Avoid generic templates ‚Äî instead, dynamically generate role-specific text using context.

‚û§ B. Job Requirements (Auto-Generated)
Based on the same inputs, especially languages required and certifications, the AI should generate a clear, specific list of technical skills, soft skills, and qualification requirements.

The AI should ensure:

Seniority level = matching experience requirements.

Certification field is reflected in the requirement bullet points.

Language fluency is shown as a requirement (not hidden).

Workplace type influences flexibility/availability expectations.

üîÑ Layout Update (Field Reordering for Better Flow):
To improve both user experience and AI logic, adjust the order of fields in the modal as follows:

Job Title

Employment Type

Workplace Type

Seniority Level

Industry

Certifications

Languages Required

‚û§ Job Description (auto-generated from the above)

‚û§ Job Requirements (auto-generated from the above)

[Any other existing fields to remain as-is]

‚ú≥Ô∏è Note: Certifications and languages should come before the job description/requirements fields to allow the AI to consider them fully when generating content.
