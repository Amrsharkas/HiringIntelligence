Prompt:
Create a standalone employer-facing web application that makes hiring more efficient, smarter, and faster for employers. This is one part of a two-platform system, and will only include employer functionalities. Build the platform using a 3D interactive website structure, where the UI responds to scrolling, clicking, and hovering. The website must look extremely professional, aesthetically pleasing, and feature 3D/animated design similar to Zypsy.com to reflect an advanced tech brand.

📄 Pages to Build
1. Homepage (Public Landing Page for Employers Only)
Explain the problems with modern hiring (e.g., wasted time, poor candidate fits, inefficient filtering).

Highlight our innovation: using AI to assess candidates through interviews and generate detailed user profiles that are matched to job postings with a 1–100 rating.

Include CTA buttons:

"Post a Job Now" → Leads to sign-up

"Login"

Should feature rich 3D visuals, scroll-activated animations, and interaction on hover or scroll.

2. Login / Signup Flow
Allow employers to create an account with fields like:

Name

Company Name

Email + Password

After sign-up, assign the user a "role": employer and never ask again.

On login, direct them to their Employer Dashboard.

🧠 Employer Dashboard (Core Functionality)
Build a clean, animated, 3D interactive dashboard. This page should never route users away when interacting with features — all features open in modals or slide-in popouts.

Features/Modals:
✅ 1. Post a Job Modal
Form fields:

Job Title

Salary Range

Job Description (Text Box + “AI Generate” button)

Job Requirements (Text Box + “AI Generate” button)

Skills Section:

Soft Skills Dropdown: static options (e.g., communication, leadership, teamwork)

Technical Skills Dropdown: dynamic and AI-powered, based on job title and description.

This should update live every 0.1 seconds as the job title/description is typed.

Once submitted:

Store job in:

The company's personal job list

The platform’s global job postings database

✅ 2. Active Jobs Modal
Automatically updates when new jobs are posted.

Shows a list of the company’s job postings.

Each entry includes:

📝 Edit Icon → reopens the Post Job modal pre-filled with current info

🗑️ Delete Icon → removes job posting

✅ 3. Candidate Viewer Modal
For each posted job, a "View Candidates" button appears.

Clicking it opens a modal showing all matched candidates with:

Their AI-generated match rating (1–100)

A short summary of their user profile

A "View Full Profile" button

Note: You do not need to implement the full profile here, only the interface for pulling matched candidates by job from the database.

💾 Database & AI Integration Guidelines
Use a clean schema with two main models:

Jobs: includes employer ID, job title, description, salary, skills (soft + technical)

Candidates: read-only from this platform, but can be queried for ratings/matches

Store job postings in both:

The company’s specific job list

The platform-wide job index (for matchmaking)

AI usage:

Use OpenAI API for:

Generating job descriptions & requirements

Extracting dynamic technical skills from job title/description

Use existing matching algorithm API (I will provide API key) to rate candidates for jobs

🔐 Security/Permissions
Only logged-in employers should be able to view and interact with the dashboard.

Each employer can only access their own job postings and candidate matches.

🎨 Style Guide
Match the branding of a top-tier AI recruiting platform.

Use 3D graphics, animated transitions, and dark/light mode toggle.

Mobile responsiveness is not required at MVP but preferred.
