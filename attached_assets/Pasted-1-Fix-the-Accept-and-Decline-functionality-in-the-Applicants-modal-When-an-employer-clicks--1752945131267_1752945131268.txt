1. Fix the Accept and Decline functionality in the Applicants modal:
   - When an employer clicks **Accept**:
     - Hide the Accept/Decline buttons.
     - Replace them with a "Schedule Interview" button (same UI as current).
     - This button must route to the **working Create Interview modal** (from Quick Actions).
     - Immediately update the **"platojobmatches"** table in Airtable:
       - Base ID: app1u4N2W46jD43mP
       - API Key: {{insert actual API key here}}
       - The data should be pulled directly from the **platojobapplications** and corresponding **platojobpostings** records:
         - `Name` → from `Applicant Name` in `platojobapplications`
         - `User ID` → from `User ID` in `platojobapplications` (**this is critical**)
         - `Job title` → from matching job posting
         - `Job Description` → from job posting
         - `Company name` → from job posting

   - When an employer clicks **Decline**:
     - Immediately delete the record from `platojobapplications`.
     - Refresh the Applicants and Candidates modals to reflect this change.

2. In the **Applicants modal**:
   - Only show applicants from the `platojobapplications` table.
   - Use the field `Applicant Name` to display the name (not "Unknown Applicant").
   - Show AI match score, job title, analysis summary, and date applied.
   - Stack applicants horizontally.
   - Include a refresh button and auto-refresh every 30 seconds.

3. In the **Candidates modal**:
   - Continue using `platouserprofiles` table.
   - Only display candidates with an AI score > 85.
   - Keep layout and UI styling as is.
   - Add refresh button and auto-refresh every 30 seconds.

4. When **Schedule Interview** is clicked (after acceptance or through Quick Actions):
   - Show a modal with:
     - Dropdown to select a user (filter from already accepted users in `platojobmatches`)
     - Input for date & time
     - Input for interview link (optional)
   - On confirmation, update the **existing record** in `platojobmatches`:
     - `Interview date&time` → selected datetime
     - `Interview Link` → input link if provided

5. On the **applicant’s dashboard**:
   - Add an “Interviews” modal.
   - Pull data from `platojobmatches` table.
   - Show interviews where `User ID` matches the current logged-in user.
   - Display:
     - Job title
     - Company name
     - Interview date & time
     - Interview link (if provided)

6. In the **Employer Dashboard UI**:
   - Replace the broken "Schedule Interview" button with the working **Create Interview** button (the one in Quick Actions).
   - Keep the existing visual design of the interview icon/button—just reroute the functionality.
