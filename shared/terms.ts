PLATO TERMS OF SERVICE – EMPLOYERS
Last Updated: November 6, 2025

IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Plato online
platform, web applications, mobile applications, APIs, and related services (collectively,
the “Service”) in your capacity as an employer, recruiter, staffing agency, or other
organization using the Service to manage recruitment and hiring (“Employer”, “you”).

By creating an Employer account, subscribing to, or otherwise accessing or using the
Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these
Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.

ABOUT PLATO AND THE SERVICE
1.1 Identity of the Provider
The Service is provided by Plato (“Plato”, “we”, “us”, “our”), a cloud-based recruitment
and interview technology provider.

1.2 Scope of the Service
Plato offers a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that allows Employers to:
(a) create and manage job postings;
(b) invite candidates and receive applications;
(c) conduct interviews (video, audio, or text);
(d) administer assessments and questionnaires;
(e) review analytics, recommendations, and AI-assisted scores;
(f) manage candidate pipelines and workflows;
(g) collaborate internally on hiring decisions.

1.3 Relationship with Applicants
While Plato provides the technological platform, all employment decisions, including
whether to interview, hire, promote, or reject an Applicant, are made solely by you as the
Employer. Plato is not a party to any employment contract between you and an Applicant and
does not provide legal, HR, or compliance advice.

ELIGIBILITY, AUTHORITY, AND ACCOUNT SETUP
2.1 Organizational Eligibility
You represent and warrant that you:
(a) are an entity duly organized and validly existing under the laws of your jurisdiction;
(b) have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and perform under these Terms;
(c) will use the Service solely for legitimate recruitment, HR, and related business
purposes.

2.2 Authority of the Signatory
If you accept these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that
you have the authority to bind that entity. “You” and “Employer” will refer to that
entity.

2.3 Administrator Accounts and Users
You may designate one or more administrators (“Admins”) with authority to create and
manage user accounts under your organization. You are responsible for:

(a) approving and managing all user access associated with your organization;
(b) ensuring each user complies with these Terms;
(c) the security of login credentials and internal access controls.

You remain liable for all acts and omissions of your users in connection with the Service.

EMPLOYER CONTENT; CANDIDATE DATA; DATA ROLES
3.1 Employer Content
“Employer Content” means all data and materials provided or made available by you to Plato
through the Service, including but not limited to:
(a) job descriptions and postings;
(b) interview scripts, custom questions, and scoring rubrics;
(c) internal notes, evaluations, and labels;
(d) branding materials, such as logos or images;
(e) integrations and configuration data.

You retain ownership of Employer Content, subject to the licenses you grant to Plato.

3.2 License to Plato (Employer Content)
You grant Plato a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable
license to host, store, reproduce, process, adapt, translate, display, and use Employer
Content for the purpose of:
(a) operating, maintaining, and providing the Service to you and your authorized users;
(b) configuring and improving the functionality of the Service;
(c) providing support and troubleshooting;
(d) ensuring security, fraud prevention, and service integrity;
(e) complying with legal obligations and enforcing our rights.

3.3 Candidate Data
“Candidate Data” includes any information about Applicants that is processed through the
Service in connection with your recruitment activities, including:
(a) CVs, resumes, cover letters, profiles, and portfolios;
(b) contact details and identifiers;
(c) interview recordings, transcripts, responses, and associated metadata;
(d) assessment responses, scores, and evaluation notes;
(e) status updates, communication logs, and hiring decisions.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are the primary party determining the
purposes and means of processing Candidate Data in the context of your use of the Service.
You agree that you are responsible for:
(a) ensuring that your collection and use of Candidate Data complies with applicable data
protection and employment laws;
(b) providing necessary notices and obtaining appropriate consents from Candidates;
(c) honoring Candidate rights (such as rights of access, correction, deletion, and
objection).

Plato processes Candidate Data to provide the Service to you and may also act as an
independent controller for certain processing activities required to operate and improve
the platform (e.g., security, fraud detection, and model training), as described below and
in our Privacy Policy.

USE OF CVS AND CANDIDATE DATA FOR AI MODEL TRAINING
4.1 CVs and Application Materials
When CVs, resumes, or related application materials are uploaded or otherwise processed
via the Service in connection with your account, you acknowledge and agree that:
(a) Plato may retain, process, and use these documents and corresponding structured data
to train, test, and improve AI and machine learning models used in the Service; and
(b) where reasonably possible, Plato will apply data minimization, aggregation,
pseudonymization, or de-identification so that raw documents used for model training are
not directly tied to identified individuals.

4.2 Explicit Clause – Use for Model Training but Not for Sourcing
You specifically agree to the following:
(a) Plato is permitted to retain and use Candidate CVs, resumes, and related application
data for the limited purpose of training, testing, and improving its current and future AI
and machine learning models and algorithms.
(b) Plato will not use Candidate CVs or associated Candidate Data obtained through your
Employer account to independently source or recruit those candidates for other Employers,
or to build a separate commercial candidate marketplace, without a separate and explicit
opt-in from the Candidate (for example, if the Candidate creates their own public talent
profile and consents to broader visibility).
(c) For clarity: CV data may be used to increase the accuracy and capabilities of generic
models and platform features, but it will not be repurposed as a proprietary candidate
pool offered to other Employers, except in cases where the Candidate has independently
consented to that broader use.

4.3 Use of Interview and Assessment Data
Interview and Assessment Data (as described in the Applicant Terms) may also be used to
train, test, and improve AI models. Plato may aggregate and de-identify such data across
Employers and Candidates to improve global model performance, benchmark outcomes, and
develop new platform functionality.

4.4 De-Identification and Aggregation
Where feasible and consistent with business needs, Plato will use techniques such as
aggregation, pseudonymization, or de-identification before using Candidate Data for model
training. De-identified data may be retained for a longer period than identified data, for
the legitimate interest of improving platform performance and safety.

EMPLOYER OBLIGATIONS AND ACCEPTABLE USE
5.1 Lawful Use Only
You agree to use the Service only for lawful recruitment and HR-related purposes and to
comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines, including those relating to:
(a) employment and labor;

(d) background checks, where applicable.

5.2 Prohibited Uses
You must not:
(a) use the Service to engage in unlawful discrimination or unfair hiring practices;

legitimate recruitment;
(d) resell, lease, or provide the Service to third parties as a standalone product without
Plato’s written authorization;

authorization;
(f) reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the
Service or its models;
(g) use automated means to scrape, extract, or export Candidate Data at scale except as
permitted by Plato’s APIs or by written agreement;
(h) use the Service to build or train a competing product.

5.3 Responsibility for Hiring Decisions
You acknowledge and agree that:
(a) AI-generated scores, recommendations, or rankings are assistive tools only and do not
constitute final hiring decisions;
(b) you remain solely responsible for all decisions you make about Applicants;
(c) you are responsible for reviewing and validating any AI-based evaluation to ensure
compliance with your internal policies and applicable law.

SUBSCRIPTIONS, FEES, AND PAYMENT
6.1 Subscription Plans and Credits

Service level objectives, if any, may be described in a separate service level agreement

no material essential functionality is removed during an active paid term without
providing a reasonable alternative or adjustment.

typically specified on the website or in your commercial agreement.

DATA SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY

and Candidate Data against unauthorized access, loss, or alteration. These may include
encryption, access control, logging, monitoring, and regular security reviews.

(d) is independently developed without reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential
Information.

8.4 Legal Disclosures
A party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by law, court order,

party prompt notice and an opportunity to seek a protective order.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND FEEDBACK

Service during the applicable subscription term for your internal business purposes
relating to recruitment and HR.
