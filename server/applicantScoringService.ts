CANDIDATE PROFILE:

CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS - BE EXTREMELY HARSH AND REALISTIC - MOST CANDIDATES SHOULD SCORE POORLY:

1. OVERALL MATCH (0-100): How well does this candidate actually fit this specific job? BE STRICT - most should score 20-40%.
2. TECHNICAL SKILLS (0-100): Do they have the exact technical abilities mentioned in requirements? DEMAND SPECIFICS - generic mentions = low scores.
3. EXPERIENCE (0-100): Do they have directly relevant work experience for this exact role and level? YEARS MATTER - junior for senior = very low score.
4. CULTURAL FIT (0-100): Based on available info, would they fit the work style and values? MINIMAL INFO = LOW SCORE.

MANDATORY SCORING GUIDELINES - NO EXCEPTIONS:
- 0-15: No relevant information, profile too vague, completely wrong field, or irrelevant experience
- 16-30: Some basic info but major gaps, wrong experience level, unrelated skills, or entry-level for senior role
- 31-45: Has some relevant background but missing key requirements, insufficient experience, or skills don't match
- 46-60: Meets some requirements but has notable gaps, moderate experience, or some skill mismatches
- 61-75: Good match with minor gaps, relevant experience, most skills present
- 76-85: Strong match with all major requirements, solid experience, excellent skills
- 86-95: Exceptional candidate, exceeds requirements, extensive relevant experience
- 96-100: Perfect match, world-class expertise, ideal candidate (EXTREMELY RARE)
- 26-40: Partially relevant but significant shortcomings in key areas
- 41-60: Decent match with some relevant experience but missing important requirements
- 61-75: Good candidate with most requirements but not exceptional
- 76-90: Strong candidate with all/most requirements and good experience
- 91-100: Perfect match with exceptional qualifications (RARE)

HARSH REALITY CHECKS:
- If the profile mentions "student" or "looking for experience" and job requires 5+ years ‚Üí Experience should be 5-15%
- If they list irrelevant skills (e.g., social media for engineering role) ‚Üí Technical Skills should be 10-25%  
- If profile is vague without concrete examples ‚Üí All scores should be 15-35%
- If no cultural indicators are provided ‚Üí Cultural Fit should be 20-40%
- NEVER give high scores without clear evidence in the profile

EXAMPLES OF REALISTIC SCORING:
- Junior candidate for senior role: Overall 15-25%, Experience 5-15%
- Unrelated field experience: Technical 10-20%, Overall 15-30%
- Vague generic profile: All scores 20-35%
- Missing key requirements: Relevant scores 15-40%
- 16-30: Minimal relevance, major gaps in all areas
- 31-50: Some basic relevance but significant gaps
- 51-70: Good qualifications with minor gaps
- 71-85: Strong qualifications meeting most requirements
- 86-95: Exceptional candidate exceeding requirements
- 96-100: Perfect match (extremely rare)

CRITICAL RULES:
- If profile mentions completely unrelated skills (like "rower" for a developer job), give 5-15 points max
- If no relevant experience is mentioned, technical skills should be 0-20
- If no education/background info, experience should be 0-25
- Be honest about gaps - don't assume qualifications that aren't explicitly stated
- A good candidate should score 60-75, exceptional 75-85, perfect 85+

CRITICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- If the profile is empty, vague, or has minimal information (like just "rower" or single words), score 0-15
- If there's no relevant experience or skills mentioned, score 0-25
- If there's some relevant experience but major gaps, score 25-45
- If there's good relevant experience with minor gaps, score 45-65
- If there's strong relevant experience with most requirements met, score 65-80
- Only score 80+ if the candidate is exceptionally qualified with all key requirements

SCORING RULES:
- Be HARSH and REALISTIC
- Incomplete profiles = Very low scores (0-15)
- Irrelevant experience = Low scores (0-30)
- Questionable fit = Medium scores (30-50)
- Good fit = Higher scores (50-70)
- Exceptional fit = High scores (70-85)
