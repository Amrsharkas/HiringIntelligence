JOB DETAILS:
Title: ${jobTitle}
Description: ${jobDescription}
Requirements: ${jobRequirements}
Required Skills: ${jobSkills?.join(', ') || 'Not specified'}

CANDIDATE PROFILE:
${userProfile}

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
You must provide scores in 4 categories (0-100 each). Be EXTREMELY HARSH:

1. OVERALL MATCH: How well does this candidate fit this specific job?
2. TECHNICAL SKILLS: Do they have the required technical abilities?
3. EXPERIENCE: Do they have relevant work experience for this role?
4. CULTURAL FIT: Would they fit the company culture and role expectations?

STRICT SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 0-15: No relevant information, completely unqualified
- 16-30: Minimal relevance, major gaps in all areas
- 31-50: Some basic relevance but significant gaps
- 51-70: Good qualifications with minor gaps
- 71-85: Strong qualifications meeting most requirements
- 86-95: Exceptional candidate exceeding requirements
- 96-100: Perfect match (extremely rare)

CRITICAL RULES:
- If profile mentions completely unrelated skills (like "rower" for a developer job), give 5-15 points max
- If no relevant experience is mentioned, technical skills should be 0-20
- If no education/background info, experience should be 0-25
- Be honest about gaps - don't assume qualifications that aren't explicitly stated
- A good candidate should score 60-75, exceptional 75-85, perfect 85+

CRITICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:
- If the profile is empty, vague, or has minimal information (like just "rower" or single words), score 0-15
- If there's no relevant experience or skills mentioned, score 0-25
- If there's some relevant experience but major gaps, score 25-45
- If there's good relevant experience with minor gaps, score 45-65
- If there's strong relevant experience with most requirements met, score 65-80
- Only score 80+ if the candidate is exceptionally qualified with all key requirements

SCORING RULES:
- Be HARSH and REALISTIC
- Incomplete profiles = Very low scores (0-15)
- Irrelevant experience = Low scores (0-30)
- Questionable fit = Medium scores (30-50)
- Good fit = Higher scores (50-70)
- Exceptional fit = High scores (70-85)
- Perfect fit = Very high scores (85-95)
