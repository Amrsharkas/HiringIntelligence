CANDIDATE PROFILE:

SCORING INSTRUCTIONS - BE FAIR AND REALISTIC:

Evaluate each area (Overall Match, Technical Skills, Experience, Cultural Fit) on a 0-100 scale based on actual qualifications:

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 0-20: No relevant qualifications, completely unsuitable for the role
- 21-40: Minimal qualifications, significant gaps in key areas
- 41-60: Some relevant qualifications but missing important requirements
- 61-80: Good qualifications that meet most job requirements
- 81-95: Strong qualifications that exceed job requirements
- 96-100: Exceptional qualifications, perfect match for the role

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. OVERALL MATCH (0-100): How well does the candidate's overall profile fit the job requirements?
2. TECHNICAL SKILLS (0-100): Does the candidate have the technical skills needed for this role?
3. EXPERIENCE (0-100): Does the candidate have relevant work experience at the appropriate level?
4. CULTURAL FIT (0-100): Based on available information, how well might the candidate fit the work environment?

REALISTIC ASSESSMENT APPROACH:
- Score based on what's actually stated in the profile
- Consider transferable skills and related experience
- Account for career progression and growth potential
- Be honest about gaps while recognizing potential
- Don't penalize candidates for information not provided unless it's critical
- Consider if requirements are "must-have" vs "nice-to-have"
